# 🌍 Analysis of Tourist Arrivals in Morocco (2012-2020) 📊

Welcome to the "Analysis of Tourist Arrivals in Morocco" project repository. This project aims to analyze the evolution of tourist arrivals at Moroccan border posts over the years 2012 to 2020. The analysis provides insights into tourism trends, patterns, and the impact of various factors on tourist inflow. 

In this project, we have applied Correspondence Analysis (AFC) to uncover hidden relationships and patterns in the data, shedding light on the dynamics of tourist arrivals from different nationalities.
## 📁 Data Source

The dataset used for this analysis is part of the comprehensive dataset published by the Ministry of Tourism, Crafts, and Social and Solidarity Economy on April 14, 2022, available on the [data.gov.ma](https://www.data.gov.ma) website.

These data provide a detailed numerical representation of the nationality of tourist arrivals in Morocco. Their significance lies in their role as a statistical tool for tourism analysis, decision-making, and gaining insights into tourist trends.

The graph above shows the relationships between the points lines:

● Nationalities with a similar profile such as the United Kingdom, MRE and Scandinavia are grouped together, however China is alone because it has a different profile from the others.

● Line points like France and United Kingdom which are far from the origin are well represented on the graph.

● We can see that countries colored red such as France, China and the United States are well represented and countries colored blue are weakly represented such as Scandinavia.
