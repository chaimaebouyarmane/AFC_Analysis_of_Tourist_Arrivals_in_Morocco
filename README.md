# üåç Analysis of Tourist Arrivals in Morocco (2012-2020) üìä

Welcome to the "Analysis of Tourist Arrivals in Morocco" project repository. This project aims to analyze the evolution of tourist arrivals at Moroccan border posts over the years 2012 to 2020. The analysis provides insights into tourism trends, patterns, and the impact of various factors on tourist inflow. 

In this project, we have applied Correspondence Analysis (AFC) to uncover hidden relationships and patterns in the data, shedding light on the dynamics of tourist arrivals from different nationalities.
## üìÅ Data Source

The dataset used for this analysis is part of the comprehensive dataset published by the Ministry of Tourism, Crafts, and Social and Solidarity Economy on April 14, 2022, available on the [data.gov.ma](https://www.data.gov.ma) website.

These data provide a detailed numerical representation of the nationality of tourist arrivals in Morocco. Their significance lies in their role as a statistical tool for tourism analysis, decision-making, and gaining insights into tourist trends.

In the graph above, the rows are represented by blue dots and the columns by red triangles.
This graph shows that:

‚óè China, the United States and Belgium are close to Dim1.

‚óè MRE, United Kingdom and Spain are close to Dim2.

The graph above shows the relationships between the points lines:

‚óè Nationalities with a similar profile such as the United Kingdom, MRE and Scandinavia are grouped together, however China is alone because it has a different profile from the others.

‚óè Line points like France and United Kingdom which are far from the origin are well represented on the graph.

‚óè We can see that countries colored red such as France, China and the United States are well represented and countries colored blue are weakly represented such as Scandinavia.

‚óè Years like 2016, 2015‚Ä¶. which are well represented are colored red.

‚óè the year 2020 which is in blue color is weakly represented.

### Explanation of results

Here are some possible explanations for these observations:

+ Moroccans living abroad visited Morocco more in 2015 due to COP 22, which was held in Marrakech in November of this year. COP 22 attracted many Moroccans living abroad, who took the opportunity to visit their country of origin.
  
+ Germans visited Morocco more in 2017 due to the FIFA World Cup, which was held in Morocco in June and July this year. The World Cup attracted many German tourists, who wanted to discover Morocco.
  
+ The French visited Morocco more in 2012 due to the campaign to promote Moroccan tourism in France. This campaign was launched in 2012 and helped increase the notoriety of Morocco in France.
  
+ The low representation in 2020 can be explained by the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a drop in tourist arrivals in Morocco.
